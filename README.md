# Euler Solves

A Go application to solve Project Euler problems. Over-engineered for fun and learning.

## Building the Application

TODO: Add instructions for building the application.

## About Euler Problems

The Euler problems are a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just
mathematical insights to solve. They are designed to be solved with programming, and they often involve algorithms,
data structures, and computational techniques.

More details can be found on the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/).
